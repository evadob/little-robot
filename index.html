        <h1>About Robik</h1>
        <p>
          Once upon a time, there was a little robot named Robik. One day, he
          set off on an adventure to the human city. On his journey, he
          encountered a malevolent robot named Trpaslíktron, who wanted to take
          control of the city. Robik was clever, a very clever one indeed. He
          discovered that Trpaslíktron was dependent on old batteries, which
          hindered his enthusiasm for new things. So, Robik gathered all the old
          batteries in the city and devised a plan.

        <p>
          As Trpaslíktron sought power, Robik unleashed a massive fireworks,
          completely overwhelming Trpaslíktron. In that moment, Robik swiftly
          replaced his old batteries with new ones, and Trpaslíktron transformed
          into a friendly robot. The people were thrilled and praised Robik's
          abilities. He became their hero, and together with Trpaslíktron, they
          worked together to make the city a better place.

        <p>
          One day, a circus arrived in the city, featuring special robotic
          performances. The star attraction was a magical robot named Alfi. She
          was a stunning robotic lady who could perform mesmerizing tricks with
          laser beams and had a beautiful robotic voice for singing. When Robik
          saw Alfi for the first time, he was captivated by her elegance and
          artistry. He felt a desire to get to know her, but he was too shy and
          unsure how to approach her. Nevertheless, he decided to observe her
          from afar and attempted to find a way to enter her world.
